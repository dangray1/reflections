What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It turns the folder into a Git repository.  You need to do it for the changes to the folder to be tracked (from then on).

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to select only certain changes to your working directory as candidates to be committed to
your repo.  This allows you to commit things you are happy with while leaving others, and lets you split your commits
more logically.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By only adding one file to it at a time before committing.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

When two different features are being worked on simultaneously.  Splitting this into two branches would seperate the
commit histories and make it easier to trace logical changes in the code.
