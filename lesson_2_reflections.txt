What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It turns the folder into a Git repository.  You need to do it for the changes to the folder to be tracked (from then on).

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to select only certain changes to your working directory as candidates to be committed to
your repo.  This allows you to commit things you are happy with while leaving others, and lets you split your commits
more logically.
